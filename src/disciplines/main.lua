  -- Line disciplines are a middle layer between the raw stream
  -- and the character device, and provide certain services -
  -- for instance, the TTY line discipline is what makes ctrl-C,
  -- ctrl-\, and ctrl-Z work.  This line discipline can be put
  -- over a network socket, a serial connection, or a virtual
  -- TTY provided by the kernel - and the application (ideally
  -- the user, too) will see no difference in behavior.
